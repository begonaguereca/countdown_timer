# Count Down Timer

Implemented a Javascript program that works as a count down timer. 

It takes a start time which should be in hh:mm:ss format, which represents: hour, minute and seconds, respectively. It also takes an end time in the same format. The timer will countdown a number that is the differnce between the start and end time.Created a button with "Start Countdown" text on it. When user clicks the button, it:Verifys both inputs' validity, and throws error message if there is a problem, e.g. input format, intervals, etc.The Reset button resets the stop watch.
